HTTPS - secure version of HTTP
        - all communications between browser and the websites are encrypted.
        - often used to protect highly confidential online transactions
HTTPS pages - use one of two secure protocols to encrypt communications(SSL[secure sockets layer] or TLS[Transport Layer Security])
+ Both TLS and SSL use an assymetric Public key Infrastructure(PKI) system
Assymetric System - uses two keys to encrypt communications *private key & *public key
*** anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and vice-versa
private key - only accessible by owner and remains securely ensconce on the web server.
public key - anybody that wants to decrypt information encrypted by the private key
